@BigQuery_Source
Feature: BigQuery sink - Verification of BigQuery to BigQuery successful data transfer

@BQ_SOURCE_TEST @BQ_SINK_TEST
Scenario:Validate successful records transfer from BigQuery to BigQuery with partition type TIME
Given Open Datafusion Project to configure pipeline
When Source is BigQuery
When Sink is BigQuery
Then Open BigQuery source properties
Then Enter BigQuery property reference name
Then Enter BigQuery property projectId "projectId"
Then Enter BigQuery property datasetProjectId "projectId"
Then Override Service account details if set in environment variables
Then Enter BigQuery property dataset "dataset"
Then Enter BigQuery source property table name
Then Validate output schema with expectedSchema "bqSourceSchemaDatatype"
Then Validate "BigQuery" plugin properties
Then Close the BigQuery properties
Then Validate "BigQuery" plugin properties
Then Close the BigQuery properties
Then Open BigQuery sink properties
Then Enter BigQuery property reference name
Then Enter BigQuery property projectId "projectId"
Then Enter BigQuery property datasetProjectId "projectId"
Then Override Service account details if set in environment variables
Then Enter BigQuery property dataset "dataset"
Then Enter BigQuery sink property table name
Then Toggle BigQuery sink property truncateTable to true
Then Toggle BigQuery sink property updateTableSchema to true
Then Enter BigQuery sink property partition field "bqPartitionFieldTime"
Then Validate "BigQuery" plugin properties
Then Close the BigQuery properties
Then Connect source as "BigQuery" and sink as "BigQuery" to establish connection
Then Save the pipeline
Then Preview and run the pipeline
Then Wait till pipeline preview is in running state
Then Open and capture pipeline preview logs
Then Verify the preview run status of pipeline in the logs is "succeeded"
Then Close the pipeline logs
Then Close the preview
Then Deploy the pipeline
Then Run the Pipeline in Runtime
Then Wait till pipeline is in running state
Then Open and capture logs
Then Verify the pipeline status is "Succeeded"
Then Verify the partition table is created with partitioned on field "bqPartitionFieldTime"
